            I released my first song, "Standing At The Funeral" in October of 2019. Since then, I have released 6 more songs, achieving 138,000+ streams on Spotify, and having my songs featured on Spotify Editorial Playlists such as "Fresh Finds". I'm a guitarist, a singer, and a music producer, with a love for John Mayer, and I have mainly made alternate pop music, with some singer - songwriter style pieces in there as well. Please have a listen!
