            <p>
                After starting to work at my 9-5 job,
                I wanted to track the mistakes I made to hold myself accountable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tracked the number of successful work events completed,
                and the number of errors that I carried out, to determine what my percentage success rate was.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realised that I could represent this idea mathematically to determine how many work events were required to regain parity with previous
                success rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                This formed the basis of my idea of the "remissio culpae" formula,
                a formula to determine the amount of successful work event completions required to regain a prior reputation, and thus gain "forgiveness" of sin, or error.
            </p>
